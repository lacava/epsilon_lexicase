Many-objective optimization brings with it a number of challenges that must be addressed, which highlights the need for new and better algorithms that can efficiently handle the growing number of objectives. This article reviews the different challenges associated with many-objective optimization and the work that has been done in the recent-past to alleviate these difficulties. It also highlights how the existing methods and body of knowledge have been used to address the different real world many-objective problems. Finally, it brings focus to some future research opportunities that exist with many-objective optimization. We report in this article what is commonly used, be it algorithms or test problems, so that the reader knows what are the benchmarks and also what other options are available. We deem this to be especially useful for new researchers and for researchers from other fields who wish to do some work in the area of many-objective optimization.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the performance of several semantic- aware selection methods for genetic programming (GP). In particular, we consider methods that do not rely on complete GP semantics (i.e., a tuple of outputs produced by a program for fitness cases (tests)), but on binary outcome vectors that only state whether a given test has been passed by a program or not. This allows us to relate to test-based problems commonly considered in the domain of coevolutionary algorithms and, in prospect, to address a wider range of practical problems, in particular the problems where desired program output is unknown (e.g., evolving GP controllers). The selection methods considered in the paper include implicit fitness sharing (ifs), discovery of derived objectives (doc), lexicase selection (lex), as well as a hybrid of the latter two. These techniques, together with a few variants, are experimentally compared to each other and to conventional GP on a battery of discrete benchmark problems. The outcomes indicate superior performance of lex and ifs, with some variants of doc showing certain potential.},

	shorttitle = {Machine {Science}},
	abstract = {The work presented here advances the technology to analyze experimental data and automatically hypothesize about explanatory models and physical laws that help explain observations. Automated Modeling, sometimes referred to as Symbolic Regression or System Identification, is the process of searching a possibly infinite space of mathematical expressions in order to optimize various objectives—for example, identifying the simplest possible nonlinear equation that captures the observed dynamics of a system. Traditionally, the task of formulating analytical models and theory has remained entirely within the purview of human expertise, and also human limitation. However, the development of Evolutionary Algorithms, and more recently Genetic Programming, has made searching for analytical models automatically a possibility. The work presented here focuses on advancing the algorithms and techniques for Automated Modeling to shrink this “reality gap,” and applies these advances to various real and experimental systems for the first time. The specific contributions of this work fall into four categories: search methods and algorithms, model representations and the types of systems that can be analyzed, techniques for interpreting solutions and results, and applications in science and engineering fields. The most important contribution in the search methods is the Fitness and Rank Prediction algorithm, which enables utilizing exceedingly large data sets with low computational effort. This algorithm is based on the idea that, at any given time, only a small number of carefully selected data points are necessary to discriminate among candidate models, allowing large reductions in computational effort. In model representations, the most important contribution is the principle for identifying meaningful invariant quantities amongst the infinite number of trivial invariant expressions. This principle enables searching for physical laws and conservations directly from experimental measurements. In the interpretation of results, the most important contribution is Parameter Mapping technique, which relates an automatically inferred model to a previous model through repeated regressions. Finally, the most important contribution in applications is the analysis of yeast Glycolytic oscillations, which demonstrates and compares several techniques in order to identify a complete nonlinear ordinary differential equation model directly from data.},

Three treatments are compared: raw fitness, pure fitness sharing, and a gradual change from fitness sharing to raw fitness. The 6- and 11-multiplexer problems are compared. Using the same population sizes, fitness sharing shows a large improvement in the error rate for both problems. Further experiments compare the treatments on learning recursive list membership functions; again, there are dramatic improvements in error rate. Conversely, fitness sharing runs achieve comparable results to raw fitness using populations two to three times smaller. Measures of population diversity suggest that the results are due to preservation of diversity and avoidance of premature convergence by the fitness sharing runs.},

	abstract = {This study presents an extensive account of Locally Geometric Semantic Crossover (LGX), a semantically-aware recombination operator for genetic programming (GP). LGX is designed to exploit the semantic properties of programs and subprograms, in particular the geometry of semantic space that results from distance-based fitness functions used predominantly in GP. When applied to a pair of parents, LGX picks in them at random a structurally common (homologous) locus, calculates the semantics of subprograms located at that locus, finds a procedure that is semantically medial with respect to these subprograms, and replaces them with that procedure. The library of procedures is prepared prior to the evolutionary run and indexed by a multidimensional structure (kd-tree) allowing for efficient search. The paper presents the rationale for LGX design and an extensive computational experiment concerning performance, computational cost, impact on program size, and capability of generalization. LGX is compared with six other operators, including conventional tree-swapping crossover, semantic-aware operators proposed in previous studies, and control methods designed to verify the importance of homology and geometry of the semantic space. The overall conclusion is that LGX, thanks to combination of the semantically medial operation with homology, improves the efficiency of evolutionary search, lowers the variance of performance, and tends to be more resistant to overfitting.},

This paper describes how to reduce the number of such evaluations by selecting a small subset of the training data set on which to actually carry out the GP algorithm. Three subset selection methods described in the paper are: Dynamic Subset Selection (DSS), using the current GP run to select ‘difficult’ and/or disused cases, Historical Subset Selection (HSS), using previous GP runs, Random Subset Selection (RSS). Various runs have shown that GP+DSS can produce better results in less than 20\% of the time taken by GP. GP+HSS can nearly match the results of GP, and, perhaps surprisingly, GP+RSS can occasionally approach the results of GP. GP+DSS also produced better, more general results than those reported in a paper for a variety of Neural Networks when used on a substantial problem, known as the Thyroid problem.},

Many of the problems that have long motivated genetic programming research, including the automation of many traditional programming tasks, are uncompromising. We describe and analyze the recently proposed “lexicase” parent selection algorition and show that it can facilitate the solution of uncompromising problems by genetic programming. Unlike most traditional parent selection techniques, lexicase selection does not base selection on a fitness value that is aggregated over all test cases; rather, it considers test cases one at a time in random order. We present results comparing lexicase selection to more traditional parent selection methods, including standard tournament selection and implicit fitness sharing, on four uncompromising problems: finding terms in finite algebras, designing digital multipliers, counting words in files, and performing symbolic regression of the factorial function. We provide evidence that lexicase selection maintains higher levels of population diversity than other selection methods, which may partially explain its utility as a parent selection algorithm in the context of uncompromising problems.},

	abstract = {Neutral genetic drift is an evolutionary mechanism which can strongly aid the escape from local optima. This makes neutral genetic drift an increasingly important property of Evolutionary Computational methods as more challenging applications are approached. Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) is a Genetic Programming technique which contains explicit, as well as the more common implicit, genetic redundancy. As explicit genetic redundancy is easily identified and manipulated it represents a useful tool for investigating neutral genetic drift. The contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly the paper presents a substantial evaluation of the role and benefits of neutral genetic drift in CGP. Here it is shown that the benefits of explicit genetic redundancy are additive to the benefits of implicit genetic redundancy. This is significant as it indicates that that levels of implicit genetic redundancy present in other Evolutionary Computational methods may be insufficient to fully utilise neutral genetic drift. It is also shown than the identification and manipulation of explicit genetic redundancy is far easier than for implicit genetic redundancy. This is significant as it makes the investigations here possible and leads to new possibilities for allowing more effective use of neutral genetic drift. This is the case not only for CGP, but many other Evolutionary Computational methods which contain explicit genetic redundancy. Finally, it is also shown that neutral genetic drift has additional benefits other than aiding the escape from local optima.},

	abstract = {To reduce the problem of premature convergence we define a new method for measuring an individual's age and propose the Age-Layered Population Structure (ALPS). This new measure of age measures how long the genetic material has been evolving in the population: offspring start with an age of 1 plus the age of their oldest parent instead of starting with an age of 0 as with traditional measures of age. ALPS differs from a typical evolutionary algorithm (EA) by segregating individuals into different age-layers by their age and by regularly introducing new, randomly generated individuals in the youngest layer. The introduction of randomly generated individuals at regular intervals results in an EA that is never completely converged and is always exploring new parts of the fitness landscape. By using age to restrict competition and breeding, younger individuals are able to develop without being dominated by older ones. Analysis of the search behavior of ALPS finds that the offspring of individuals that are randomly generated mid-way through a run are able to move the population out of mediocre local-optima to better parts of the fitness landscape. In comparison against a traditional EA, a multi-start EA and two other EAs with diversity maintenance schemes we find that ALPS produces significantly better designs with a higher reliability than the other EAs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to generate data-driven regression models that not only give reliable prediction of the observed data but also have smoother response surfaces and extra generalization capabilities with respect to extrapolation. These models are obtained as solutions of a genetic programming (GP) process, where selection is guided by a tradeoff between two competing objectives - numerical accuracy and the order of nonlinearity. The latter is a novel complexity measure that adopts the notion of the minimal degree of the best-fit polynomial, approximating an analytical function with a certain precision. Using nine regression problems, this paper presents and illustrates two different strategies for the use of the order of nonlinearity in symbolic regression via GP. The combination of optimization of the order of nonlinearity together with the numerical accuracy strongly outperforms ldquoconventionalrdquo optimization of a size-related expressional complexity and the accuracy with respect to extrapolative capabilities of solutions on all nine test problems. In addition to exploiting the new complexity measure, this paper also introduces a novel heuristic of alternating several optimization objectives in a 2-D optimization framework. Alternating the objectives at each generation in such a way allows us to exploit the effectiveness of 2-D optimization when more than two objectives are of interest (in this paper, these are accuracy, expressional complexity, and the order of nonlinearity). Results of the experiments on all test problems suggest that alternating the order of nonlinearity of GP individuals with their structural complexity produces solutions that are both compact and have smoother response surfaces, and, hence, contributes to better interpretability and understanding.},

	abstract = {Lexicase selection is a parent selection method that considers test cases separately, rather than in aggregate, when performing parent selection. It performs well in discrete error spaces but not on the continuous-valued problems that compose most system identification tasks. In this paper, we develop a new form of lexicase selection for symbolic regression, named ε-lexicase selection, that redefines the pass condition for individuals on each test case in a more effective way. We run a series of experiments on real-world and synthetic problems with several treatments of ε and quantify how ε affects parent selection and model performance. ε-lexicase selection is shown to be effective for regression, producing better fit models compared to other techniques such as tournament selection and age-fitness Pareto optimization. We demonstrate that ε can be adapted automatically for individual test cases based on the population performance distribution. Our experiments show that ε-lexicase selection with automatic ε produces the most accurate models across tested problems with negligible computational overhead. We show that behavioral diversity is exceptionally high in lexicase selection treatments, and that ε-lexicase selection makes use of more fitness cases when selecting parents than lexicase selection, which helps explain the performance improvement.},

Most algorithms have been developed for and tested on this limited application area. To broaden the insight in the behavior of EMO algorithms (EMOA) in higher dimensional objective spaces, a comprehensive benchmarking is presented, featuring several state-of-the-art EMOA, as well as an aggregative approach and a restart strategy on established scalable test problems with three to six objectives. It is demonstrated why the performance of well-established EMOA (NSGA-II, SPEA2) rapidly degradates with increasing dimension. Newer EMOA like ε-MOEA, MSOPS, IBEA and SMS-EMOA cope very well with high-dimensional objective spaces. Their specific advantages and drawbacks are illustrated, thus giving valuable hints for practitioners which EMOA to choose depending on the optimization scenario. Additionally, a new method for the generation of weight vectors usable in aggregation methods is presented.},

The proposed feature engineering wrapper (FEW) uses genetic programming to represent and evolve individual features tailored to the machine learning method with which it is paired. In order to maintain feature diversity, ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon -lexicase survival is introduced, a method based on ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon -lexicase selection. This survival method preserves semantically unique individuals in the population based on their ability to solve difficult subsets of training cases, thereby yielding a population of uncorrelated features. We demonstrate FEW with five different off-the-shelf machine learning methods and test it on a set of real-world and synthetic regression problems with dimensions varying across three orders of magnitude. The results show that FEW is able to improve model test predictions across problems for several ML methods. We discuss and test the scalability of FEW in comparison to other feature composition strategies, most notably polynomial feature expansion.},

It gives individuals of higher quality a higher probability of being used to create the next generation so that evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can focus on promising regions in the search space. An evolutionary learning process is dynamic and requires different selection pressures at different learning stages in order to speed up convergence or avoid local optima. Therefore, it is desirable for selection mechanisms to be able to automatically tune selection pressure during evolution. Tournament selection is a popular selection method in EAs, especially genetic algorithms and genetic programming (GP). This paper focuses on tournament selection and shows that the standard tournament selection scheme is unaware of the dynamics in the evolutionary process and that the standard tournament selection scheme is unable to tune selection pressure automatically. This paper then presents a novel approach which integrates the knowledge of the fitness rank distribution (FRD) of a population into tournament selection. Through mathematical modeling, simulations, and experimental study in GP, this paper shows that the new approach is effective and using the knowledge of FRD is a promising way to modify the standard tournament selection method for tuning the selection pressure dynamically and automatically along evolution.},

Recent contributions on Discovery of Objectives via Clustering (DOC) and Discovery of Objectives by Factorization of interaction matrix (DOF) show that informative characterizations of programs can be automatically derived from interaction matrices in discrete domains and used as search objectives in multidimensional setting. In this paper, we propose analogous methods for continuous domains and compare them with conventional GP that uses tournament selection, Age-Fitness Pareto Optimization, and GP with epsilon-lexicase selection. Experiments show that the proposed methods are effective for symbolic regression, systematically producing better-fitting models than the two former baselines, and surpassing epsilon-lexicase selection on some problems. We also investigate the hybrids of the proposed approach with the baselines, concluding that hybridization of DOC with epsilon-lexicase leads to the best overall results.},

This work proposes an angle-aware mating scheme for geometric semantic crossover in GP for symbolic regression. The angle-awareness guides the crossover operating on parents which have a large angle between their relative semantics to the target semantics. The proposed idea of angle-awareness has been incorporated into one state-of-the-art geometric crossover, the locally geometric semantic crossover. The experimental results show that, compared with locally geometric semantic crossover and the regular GP crossover, the locally geometric crossover with angle-awareness not only has a significantly better learning performance but also has a notable generalisation gain on unseen test data. Further analysis has been conducted to see the difference between the angle distribution of crossovers with and without angle-awareness, which confirms that the angle-awareness changes the original distribution of angles by decreasing the number of parents with zero degree while increasing their counterparts with large angles, leading to better performance.},
